# Problem 1975
## Summary
find a maximum sum of matrix value, if you can flip pair of adjacent values' sign anytime you want.

## Approach
hint describes about griddy but, it is easier in calculus.

- sum all absolute values
- if there is zero anywhere in matrix, all values can be positive.
- if there is even number of negative values, all values can be turned in to positive value.
- if there is no zero and odd number of negative values, it is better to turn the value who has minimum absolute value.
