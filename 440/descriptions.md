## miscellaneous talks
I knew that this problem requires mathmatical approach as soon as I read the question.
(Also, the input descripted range of 10^9, with this input range, all the time proper answer requires optimization)
However because I am so lazy, I didn't wantted to calcaulted the numbers, so I just tried brute-force method.
With no doubt, this approach times out!
